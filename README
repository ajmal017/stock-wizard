Nick Bray stock option screener
V 1.0.0
Dependencies
	-yahoo-fin
	-PyQt5
	-pandas
	
	
Currently, a frontend is up for the home screen where you can enter the ticker and click to either Options analysis or stock analysis. Neither analysis exists yet.

yahoo-fin is imported and working. get-stocks.py captures data from yahoo finance and returns a pandas dataframe. Right now, surface-level information is outputted to text to ensure workability.

Next steps:
	The most important screener for me is for covered calls. 
	Want to start calculating:
		-probability of execution for each contract
		-breakeven
		-time value of each contract (typically my strategy is to maximize TV)
		-ROI
		-annualized ROI
